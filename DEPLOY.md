# How to Host Your To-Do App for Free

Here are the best and easiest ways to host your new To-Do app for free. Since your app is "static" (just HTML, CSS, and JS), you have excellent free options.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
**Best for:** Getting a link in 30 seconds without installing anything.

1.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Open your file explorer on your computer.
3.  Locate the folder `trail` (the one containing your `index.html`).
4.  **Drag and drop the entire folder** onto the box on the Netlify webpage.
5.  Netlify will upload it and give you a live URL immediately (e.g., `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`).
6.  You can claim the site to keep it online permanently by signing up for a free account.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Best for Long Term)
**Best for:** If you want to save your code and update it easily later.

1.  Create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  Create a **New Repository** (name it something like `my-todo-app`).
3.  Upload your files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to this repository.
    *   You can do this via the web interface by clicking "Upload files".
4.  Once uploaded, go to the repository **Settings** tab.
5.  Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar.
6.  Under **Source**, select the `main` branch and click **Save**.
7.  Wait about 1-2 minutes. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/my-todo-app`.

## Option 3: Vercel
**Best for:** Professional performance and easy updates.

1.  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up (easiest with a GitHub account).
2.  Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
3.  Import your GitHub repository.
4.  Click **Deploy**.
